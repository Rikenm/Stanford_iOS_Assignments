//button inherits from control, view

//property observer : didSet, didChangeValue

// Array<Int> vs [Int]

//sender of a button is a UIbutton itself


//lecture 2
//MVC-
// model = what your application is . (Logic, flip card, knowledge of the game)

// controller : How your model is presented to the user(UI Logic)

//view : Miniions

//view to controller is generic as UI are generic. AKA view should not know what the contoller is doing

// kind of talking
// view --> action ---> flipcard in viewContoller

//view--->delegate---->view COntroller. for eg scroll view uses delegate to say I have scrolled to the end to the VC

//views--->datasource--->view controller.. view is asking for data with VC. also a Delegate

//Model to VC is notification patter AKA radio. If anything changes Model will signal and VC will listen and change the data

//multiple MVC's
//MVCs talk as if other VC are views for a particular VC.


//Struct gets free init to initiliae all it's variable

//Struct when copy is really deep copy. Also putting object inside is also makes real copy

//lazy makes var unitilizaes until someone graphs it.
//extension Array {
//    /// Picks `n` random elements (partial Fisher-Yates shuffle approach)
//    subscript (randomPick n: Int) -> [Element] {
//        var copy = self
//        for i in stride(from: count - 1, to: count - n - 1, by: -1) {
//            copy.swapAt(i, Int(arc4random_uniform(UInt32(i + 1))))
//        }
//        return Array(copy.suffix(n))
//    }
//}
//
//let digits = Array(0...9)  // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
//let pick3digits = digits[randomPick: 10]  // [8, 9, 0]

//key for the shortcut
//assistant editor is command option enter
// and to get only one assistant editor is command enter


//com=ammdn 0 left // command option 0 is right

//command shift y is debbuger

//open files directly command shift O

//control i to intent
//shift and backward lets you select multiple lines


// 0.5...15.25 not possible like 0...10 stride by 1

//for i in stride(from: 0.5, through:15.25, by:0.3){
//
//    print(i)
//}
//


//stored vs computed properties// eveytime it is excecuted

//computed property is used when you have to derive

//Access Control - internal : default<anyone can call>

//private, private(set) : set is private, get is public, fileprivate(only availabele inside the file), public,open


//assertion


//mutation keyword in struct when you mutate any properties as structs are immutable aka properties are not changed

//
//enum myError: Error{
//
//    case Network_ERROR
//    case IO_Error
//}
//
//
//func save() throws {
//
//    throw myError.Network_ERROR
//
//}
//
//
//do{
//    try save()
//
//}
//catch let error{
//
//    print(error)
//
//}


//let x = try? save() // makes x nill

// any . prepare segue has any type as it's parameter as any button, view can tigger it

// as? literally gives nill if not possible . super class and subclass lae


//protocol is a list , helps you have something similar without the base class ... claim....

//As? down casting

// NSobject --->
// NSNUmber
//Views are hierachials
// xcode builts hierachiachys

// init(frame) code, init(NSCoder) from storyboard... alternative is awakeFromNib from Nib/storyboard... initlization the view


//Drawing

// ovvveride func draw(_ rect:CGRECT)  // never calll this // you can draw outside this rect

// views bound gives you the drawing area whereas frame says where are you at

// call these

// setNeeds Display, setNeedsDisplay .. ios calls the draw, ou don't


//CALAyer

//font are also drawn

//let label = UILabel()
//label.font = UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle: .body)
//label.adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true
//size of the fonts are variable . auto layout must be used to fix the font
//let font = UIFont(name:"Roboto",size:contant or var)

// you can variable the size using metric
//let font = UIFont(name:"Roboto",size:contant or var)
// let metrics = UIFontMetrics(forTextStyle: .body)
//let fontToUse = metrics.scaledFont(for: font)


// lecture 6

// multiTouch and little bit of Drawing

// Ui view comes with drawrect

// u can draw using subview or drawing rect
// add.subview is drawing using subview. u can drag UIVIew
//u need context to draw using Core Graphics
// you draw in bounds

// if let context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(){

//
//context.addArc(center: CGPoint(x: bounds.midX, y: bounds.midY), radius: 100, startAngle: 0, endAngle: 2*CGFloat.pi, clockwise: true)
//}

// path is a consumable thing. onceyou draw it. there's no fill the path as path is gone
// when we go from land to prot or from prot to land --> we need to redraw y selectingthe inspect option.

//when drawing roundRect. make view's background be clear as white on white might not be good

// to addsubview.. overwrite layoutSubviews.

//traitColectionDidChange for font change, resource change

// setNeedsDisplay -> redraw , setNeedsLayout ->layoutSubviews

// we program at a label of tap, and many gestures

//two parts -> i) tell a view to recognize the taps (controler/ sometime view does it)ii) and provide handlers (view and controllers)


// usually gesture recognizer are added in the didset of UIView. these are called when ios hook up this outlet at runtime
// init gesture recog. target (may be view or controller self) is notified and finally action is the method invoked on recognization


// handler



//MVCS

// navVC , tabVC have a array called viewCOntrollers that stores all the View Controller for the view.

// how to get the tabVC and NavVc themselves: Every UIVC knows the split View, TabBAr or NAv VC it is currently in. These are UIViewCOntroller Properties
// like splitVIewCOntroller, tabBarController, navigationController


//Nav had push and pop vc method but we dont;t do this we use swgue
// before you do segue you might need to prepare segue by initing some variable for new VC. Every segue creates new VC. [important point]

// prepeate (for Sugue: UIStoryboard, sender: ANy)


// identifier frm
// segue identifier like detail view getting graph for detailVC .

// remember that the views outlets in the recievers VC are nil,

// should preform segue can stop segue from hapeening

// need identifier for segues as there can be multiple sugues happening from one sugue

// two ways to segue... from code(generic) and from the storyBoard

// code . some button click calls performSegue(withIdentifier:   ,sender: button or on screen click )

// story . just drag from a button to the destination VC.


// iphone has no detailView. It uses navigation .. detail and master.


//animation

// property animation

// with UIviewPropertyAniomator: Donw with a closure



//class func runninPropertyAnimator {
// with duration
//delay
//options
//animations () -> Void
//completion: another closure
//}


// another kind of animation. Flipping the card.

// create an animator.  var animator = UIDynamicAimator(referenceView: UIView)
// then say how the animation behave like gravity, frivtion, collisoion  .. let gravity = UIGravityBEhavior(); animator.addBrhavior(gravity)...
// add item to the behavior. let item1: UIDynamicItem = some UIView/ gravity.addItem(item1)

// func updateItemUsingCurrentState(item:UIDynamicItem)
// animator owns your view so if you change something, you need to provide changes through this method to the animator
//

//UIGravityBehavior
// UIAttachmentBEhavior
//collision boundary
//UISnapBehavior
// can join these behaviors using subclass


// detour closure

// memory cycle

//class Zerg{
//
//    privatr var foo = { or [weak self = self] in
//
//        self.bar() // use weakSelf
//    }
//    func bar(){}
//}

// zerg has reference to foo, foo is a closure and captures self AKA zerg, creating a memory cycle
